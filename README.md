The Python files included in this directory may be used to replicate the main results in the report. The "Python" folder contains the code and some output files generated by the code. The "Network Rules" folder contains .txt files of the network rules analyzed in the report. 

A brief overview of the Python files:
* composite_functions.py: A module of functions that are imported in the other files.
* composite_example.py: The example of Figures 1 and 5
* repressilator.py: The example of Figure 4
* ABA.py: The main ABA (plant stomatal closure) analysis.
* ABA_STN.py: Additional ABA analysis, including generation of Figure 9.
* TLGL.py: Analysis of the T-LGL (blood cancer) network.

composite_example.py and repressilator.py are good starting points, as they apply the methodology to simple networks.
